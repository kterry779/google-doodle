# Candy Google Doodle
This google doodle is for June 5th, which is national donut day. I want the doodle to be fun, bright, and very sweet. I'm planning on encorporating the donuts into the O's in Google. While this isn't a very original approach, I want to make the doodle fun to look at. I will make them spin, and animate a few sprinkles to fall off the donut.
